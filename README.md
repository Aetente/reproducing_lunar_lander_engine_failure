# reproducing_lunar_lander_engine_failure

This is a university project about reproducing results from chosen article.
I picked "Solving The Lunar Lander Problem under Uncertainty using Reinforcement Learning"
https://paperswithcode.com/paper/solving-the-lunar-lander-problem-under

I used the code for the article and wrote the part about engine failure with Pytorch, instead of Keras.
